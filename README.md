Secure Coding Review Guide
Overview
A Secure Coding Review is a systematic examination of source code to identify security vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with best practices. The goal is to detect and mitigate security flaws before deployment.

Objectives
Identify security vulnerabilities in the code.

Ensure compliance with security best practices.

Reduce the risk of exploitation by malicious actors.

Improve overall code quality and maintainability.

Scope
The review covers the following aspects:

Authentication & Authorization: Proper implementation of access controls.

Input Validation & Sanitization: Preventing injection attacks (SQLi, XSS, etc.).

Error Handling & Logging: Avoiding information leakage.

Data Protection: Secure storage and transmission of sensitive data.

Dependency Management: Identifying security risks in third-party libraries.

Secure Coding Standards: Adherence to OWASP, CERT, and language-specific best practices.

Methodology
Preliminary Review:

Understand the application's architecture and security requirements.

Identify critical modules and sensitive functions.

Automated Scanning:

Use static code analysis tools like SonarQube, Checkmarx, or Semgrep.

Identify common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS).

Manual Code Inspection:

Review high-risk areas, such as authentication logic and data handling.

Validate proper use of encryption and secure API calls.

Threat Modeling:

Identify potential attack vectors.

Analyze how an attacker might exploit vulnerabilities.

Remediation & Reassessment:

Provide recommendations and fixes.

Reevaluate the updated code for security improvements.

Tools
Recommended tools for secure code review:

Static Analysis: SonarQube, Checkmarx, Bandit (Python), Brakeman (Ruby).

Dynamic Analysis: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.

Dependency Scanning: Snyk, Dependabot, Trivy.

Best Practices
✔ Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
✔ Implement input validation to sanitize user inputs.
✔ Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit.
✔ Follow the principle of least privilege for access control.
✔ Use secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, JWT).
✔ Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
